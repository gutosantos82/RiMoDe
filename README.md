Rhythm Dance Movement Detection - automatic assessment of dance skills using smartphone accelerometer

## File description
xxx - Session ID

xxx_acc.csv - Accelerometer data: timestamp,x,y,z

SongsProfiles.csv - includes the song names, bpm of the song as per Madmon, beats detected by Madmon
For some songs (Que Seja and No Escurinho), the beats detected are 1/2 of the beats perceived by a dancer, so the BPM values were multiplied by 2.

SessionsProfile.csv - sessions id, song name, expert1 annotation for the student being on the rhythm (yes/no), expert2, expert3, expert4, expert5, expert6
